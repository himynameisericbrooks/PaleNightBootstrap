# PaleNightBootstrap

As I was learning Bootstrap, some friends of mine who own Pale Night Productions mentioned that they were working on updating and redesigning their website and I asked if I could use it for practice.
I used their logo and and product images, but did everything else from scratch with an emphasis on using Bootstrap as much as I could.
I also found the annimation for the searchbar on CodePen.
I thought it went with their company image really well after I changed the colors to red and white so it made the searchbar look like it was filling with blood whenever a user clicked on it.
While working on this project, I really wanted to learn how to do more of the backend that it would take to keep track of the online store portion of this site.
